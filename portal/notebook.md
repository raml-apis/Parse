The API notebooks are all executable! Hit "enter" in any code cell to execute it (and all cells before it that have not executed yet), or scroll to the bottom of the notebook and click "Play notebook". For more information, see [http://apinotebook.com](http://apinotebook.com).

#Considerations

- In order to run these notebooks you will need a Parse account.
- You have to register your Parse application as notebooks need Application ID, REST API Key and Master Key for authentication purposes.
- In order to test cloud function calls have to deploy a cloud function (see the Classes and colud functions notebook for details)
